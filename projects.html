  <h3>MINDIT - Mental Well-being Application</h3>
  <p>
    Designed to assist doctors with patient data management and early mental health screening. It's built using Flutter for UI and Firebase for data storage and multilingual support.
  </p>

  <div class="more-content" style="display: none;">
    <p>
      MINDIT is a mobile solution deployed at Government Rajaji Hospital, Madurai, for screening and categorizing
      mental well-being among patients. It uses a <strong>rule-based decision tree model</strong> to analyze mental
      health severity levels and is particularly useful in underserved communities.
    </p>
    <p>
      The app supports multiple languages and provides an intuitive interface for self or assisted mental wellness checks.
      It includes early-intervention features for at-risk individuals and assists doctors with categorized screening data.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Tech Stack:</strong> Flutter, Firebase (Firestore & Auth), Dart, Decision Tree Algorithm</p>
    <strong>Outcome:</strong> Enabled early mental health screening and categorization for patients

  <h3>Smart Grid Optimization - POWER AI Hackathon Winner üèÜ</h3>
    Developed a graph-based algorithm to optimize power distribution and reduce energy wastage. Securing ‚Çπ25,000 as 1st prize in the POWER AI Hackathon at TCE.

  <div class="more-content" style="display: none;">
    <h4>Methodology</h4>
    <p>
      This smart grid system uses a modified graph algorithm based on <strong>Dijkstra's algorithm</strong> to identify the most efficient energy paths between the power grid and homes.
      <br/><br/>
      <strong>Steps:</strong><br/>
        <strong>Input:</strong> Distance data collected using Google Maps API.<br/>
        <strong>Graph:</strong> Grid points and homes modeled as nodes; distances as edge weights.<br/>
        <strong>Shortest Path:</strong> Optimized Dijkstra's algorithm considering:<br/>
            üìä Priority based on real-time energy demand<br/>
            ‚öñÔ∏è Load balancing to avoid grid overload<br/>
            üîÅ Dynamic path recalculation based on grid status
    </p>

    <p><strong>Tech Stack:</strong> Python, NetworkX, Google Maps API, Jupyter Notebook</p>
     <p><strong>Outcome:</strong> Enabled equitable energy distribution in smart grids by dynamically routing power based on demand and grid health</p>
